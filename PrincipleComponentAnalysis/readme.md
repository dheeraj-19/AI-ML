# Principle Component Analysis for Data Compression

PCA can be used in multiple different applications, like data projection for dimensionality reduction

We will use PCA for image compression and reconstruction
We have a picture for the Natural Park of Montseny

Use PCA to extract the components of the image and reconstruct the image with the first 100 components, 200, 300, etc.

Then make a plot for accumulative variance (y-axis) with the number of principle components (x-axis)
